# correction-text

This repository contains a file .txt and a program that open the file and correct some punctuation and orthographic mistakes contained in it. For example, if a point is followed by a lowercase letter without any space, the program inserts a space and write the corresponding capital letter.
The file .txt contains the first few lines from "Mrs. Dalloway", Virginia Woolf. Clearly the program can be used with any other .txt file.

To launch the program: python correct_text.py
Save your .txt file in the same folder as correct_text.py!
