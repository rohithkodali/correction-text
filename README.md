# correction-text

This repository contains a file .txt and a program that opens the file and corrects some punctuation and orthographic mistakes contained in it. For example, if a point is followed by a lowercase letter without any space, the program inserts a space and write the corresponding capital letter.

The file corrections.py contains all the functions that correct the lines in a file and a function that opens a file and apply all corrections. 

The file mrs_dallowaytext.txt contains the first few lines from "Mrs. Dalloway", Virginia Woolf.

To launch the program: python correct_text.py
